Use Static Site Generation (SSG) instead of Client Side Rendering (CSR) as it gets better SEO, load times, and less stress on the browser/client. Therefore, favor using server components (without 'use client') as this way, data fetching happen at build time and can use async-await pages. We need `output: 'export'` in next.config.mjs. Data fetching with CSR will happen on the browser at page load which is not ideal as data does not change often.

Removing client component and using only server components improved load time and resources by 3x (or 1/3 of original). 077dee92f8247f4f6a8b23858aae312ba61e5ddd
