Use Static Site Generation (SSG) instead of Client Side Rendering (CSR) as it gets better SEO, load times, and less stress on the browser/client. Therefore, favor using server components (without 'use client') as this way, data fetching happen at build time and can use async-await pages. We need `output: 'export'` in next.config.mjs. Data fetching with CSR will happen on the browser at page load which is not ideal as data does not change often.
